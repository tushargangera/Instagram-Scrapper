# Instagram Scraper

This project is a Node.js application that scrapes Instagram profiles for specific hashtags and exports the data to a CSV file. It utilizes Puppeteer for web scraping and Node.js for server-side scripting.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd instagram-scraper
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/` with the following JSON payload:

   ```json
   {
     "users": ["user1", "user2"],
     "hashtag": "yourhashtag",
     "timeStamp": "yourtimestamp"
   }
   ```

   Replace `"user1", "user2"` with the Instagram usernames you want to scrape, `"yourhashtag"` with the desired hashtag, and `"yourtimestamp"` with the timestamp.

3. The server will respond with scraped data in JSON format.

4. To export the data to a CSV file, use the provided `jsonToCSV.js` script. Example usage:

   ```bash
   node jsonToCSV.js
   ```

   This will generate a CSV file with the scraped data.

## Configuration

- You can modify the port number in `index.js` by changing the `port` variable.
- Adjust Puppeteer settings or Instagram URL structures in `index.js` as needed.
